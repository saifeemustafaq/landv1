# Portfolio App Migration Plan

## Overview
This migration plan outlines the steps to consolidate two app directories (`/app` and `/my-portfolio/app`) into a single, unified app structure. The goal is to eliminate duplication, resolve conflicts, and create a more maintainable codebase.

## Current Structure Analysis
- Main app (`/app`): Contains the primary application code with portfolio features, API routes, components, and MongoDB integration
- Secondary app (`/my-portfolio/app`): Contains a simpler version with basic layout and styling

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Backup (Priority: HIGH) ‚è≥
- [ ] 1.1. Create a git branch named `app-consolidation`
- [ ] 1.2. Backup both app directories
- [ ] 1.3. Document all dependencies from both package.json files

### Phase 2: Configuration Consolidation (Priority: HIGH) ‚è≥
- [ ] 2.1. Compare and merge configuration files:
  - [ ] next.config.ts/js
  - [ ] tailwind.config.ts
  - [ ] postcss.config.mjs
  - [ ] tsconfig.json
  - [ ] eslint.config.mjs
- [ ] 2.2. Consolidate package.json dependencies
- [ ] 2.3. Update root-level configuration files with merged settings

### Phase 3: Core App Migration (Priority: HIGH) ‚è≥
- [ ] 3.1. Compare and merge layout.tsx files
- [ ] 3.2. Compare and merge globals.css files
- [ ] 3.3. Compare and merge page.tsx files
- [ ] 3.4. Update favicon.ico (choose the most recent version)

### Phase 4: Asset Migration (Priority: MEDIUM) ‚è≥
- [ ] 4.1. Consolidate public directories
  - [ ] Compare SVG files for duplicates
  - [ ] Merge unique assets
  - [ ] Update asset references in components

### Phase 5: Code Cleanup and Testing (Priority: HIGH) ‚è≥
- [ ] 5.1. Verify all imports and paths are correct
- [ ] 5.2. Test all routes and functionality
- [ ] 5.3. Run linting and fix any issues
- [ ] 5.4. Test build process
- [ ] 5.5. Document any breaking changes

### Phase 6: Cleanup (Priority: MEDIUM) ‚è≥
- [ ] 6.1. Remove my-portfolio directory
- [ ] 6.2. Update documentation
- [ ] 6.3. Clean up any temporary backup files

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. Path Dependencies
   - Risk: Breaking existing imports and references
   - Mitigation: Careful path updates and thorough testing

2. Style Conflicts
   - Risk: CSS/Tailwind conflicts between merged files
   - Mitigation: Manual review of style definitions

3. Configuration Conflicts
   - Risk: Incompatible settings between environments
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing of merged configurations

## Progress Tracking
- üî¥ Not Started
- ‚è≥ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed

## Notes
- Keep both versions functional until migration is complete and tested
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next
- Document any issues or conflicts encountered during migration

## Rollback Plan
1. Maintain backup of original directories
2. Document all changes made during migration
3. Create restore points at each phase
4. Test rollback procedure before major changes
